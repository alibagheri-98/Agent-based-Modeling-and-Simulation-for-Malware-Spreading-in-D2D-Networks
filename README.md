# Agent-based-Modeling-and-Simulation-for-Malware-Spreading-in-D2D-Networks
I reviewed the paper titled 'Agent-based Modeling and Simulation for Malware Spreading in D2D Networks' and presented it to my class as the final project for the 'Social Media' course instructed by Dr. Fazli at Sharif University of Technology during the fall of 2022.

In this paper presentes a new multi-agent model for simulating malware spread in device-to-device (D2D) 5G networks, including validation, identifying critical thresholds, and predicting malware spread characteristics.

Reading this paper sparked a fresh idea for me. I found myself pondering: What if I had 'm' dollars to promote my product? This question ignited the development of my own idea. I am currently in the process of working on this concept with the aim of writing a paper.
